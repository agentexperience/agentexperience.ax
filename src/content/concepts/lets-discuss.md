## We need your help!

The need of AX is crystal clear but the methods of how we get there are still blurry. We're kicking off the discussions for many important questions around how to think about and practically apply AX practices in the wild. This is a great opportunity for you and others to dive into the open source conversations around AX.

### Contribute to the open discussions

We host the discussions on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/agentexperience/discussions). If there's an important matter that we're not covering in the concepts and practices, start the conversation.

### Industry articles and research

If there are articles related to AX that would be useful to share with the community of AX builders, create an issue or commit a change to the site via the open source [Github](https://github.com/agentexperience/agentexperience.ax/) repository. If you're doing explorations or have gathered useful data in the areas of AX or agent-to-platform interactions, we would love to see and share your learnings broadly with the community. Just like articles, submit the research article via an issue, discussion topic, or change request on the site.


### Submit a change to the site

The code for this site is fully open on [Github](https://github.com/agentexperience/agentexperience.ax/). There's always _something_ to improve on the website. If there's an opportunity to report an issue or contribute a fix, you're invited to join the fun.
